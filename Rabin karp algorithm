// we compute hash function of the pattern and hash function of first window of text, and then compare each character.
// hash function of every window changes called rolling hash
// works better in average case than the naive solution
// worst case is still same as naive solution

// given a string and a substring, we need to find all the occurrences of the substring in the given string.
