// can be clockwise or counter clockwise doesn't matter
// ex- 'abcd' , 'cdab' - yes

// naive solution
// compare each charector of first string with character in second string

// better solution - concatenate s1 with itself and search for s2 in the new concatenated string.

bool areRotation( String s1, String s2)
{
  if(s1.length()!= s2.length())
    return false;
  s1= s1+s1;
  return (s1.indexOf(s2)>=0);
}

note - in java, indexOf() can be used for a single character as well as a substring to find the first occurance of that character in the
main string.
